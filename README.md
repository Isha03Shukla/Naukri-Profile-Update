# Naukri Profile Updater

**Objective:**  
Automatically refresh your Naukri profile daily to update the "last updated" timestamp. This helps improve your visibility to recruiters and potentially increases your chances of being shortlisted for job opportunities.

## Overview
This script logs into Naukri, navigates to your profile update section, and uploads your resumeâ€”ensuring your profile appears current to recruiters. Optionally, it can modify your resume by embedding hidden text (controlled by a flag), though by default it simply uploads the existing file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome installed
- Required Python packages:
  - `selenium`
  - `webdriver_manager`
  - `pypdf`
  - `reportlab`

## Setup
1. **Clone or Download the Script:**  
   Save the provided Python script `NaukriProfileAutomation.py` to your machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Then install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver_manager pypdf reportlab
   ```

3. **Configure the Script:**  
   - Update the resume paths (`originalResumePath` and `modifiedResumePath`) to point to your resume file.
   - Enter your Naukri username, password, and mobile number(not used in profile update anymore)) in the script.
   - Set `updatePDF = False` if you wish to upload the resume without modification.
   - Set `headless = False` to see the browser; change to `True` to run Chrome without a GUI.

## Usage
Run the script using:
```bash
python NaukriProfileAutomation.py
```

## Notes
- Ensure your file permissions allow the script to read your resume and write updates.
- Use at your own risk; secure your credentials appropriately.
